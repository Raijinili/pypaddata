Here lies code and notes for Puzzle & Dragons data.

Beware: Many files and notes are one or more of:
- Unmaintained
- Unorganized
- Incomplete
- For old versions
- Doesn't have what I learned since then

Also, I somehow still don't know how to folderize Python files. But maybe this will be helpful for someone out there.
