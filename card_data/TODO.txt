== [TODO] New versions ==
    There must be a better way to update versions.


TRY:
    - Find the version barriers:
        - Use the latest of the old version and the earliest of the new version.
        ! This could be in metadata.
        - Write a function that finds the gap.
    - Detect where awakenings are by taking old collabs which will never come back.
        - If they moved, we know where the additions were.
        - If new things are after them, we know where the additions were.
    - Can align by type, too.
    - Can check for i where cards0[:i] != cards1[:i].
