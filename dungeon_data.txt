Ver 6:

        - Two new ints at the end.
            - Seems to be numbering. E.g. Dungeons 1-1, 1-2.
        - For Special dungeons, some of them have int,emptystring,int at the end.
        - 0s at the end of the line have become emptystrings.
    - f:
        - Inserted a bunch of numbers in the middle:
            - Either position 7 or 8.
            - Seen as few as one 0 inserted, and as many as 13.
            - Oh! They're drops?

                - With +10000 for "rare"?
        - Removes dungeon start dates?

== Varargs ==

A normal floor has 11 variables after the initial semicolon.

Variable 9, AKA -3, is bitflags.
They seem to count the number of the rest of the variables.
    ``  # Ugh, no they don't. 32 means varargs.
        def ones(n):

Format of raw_dungeons:
A bunch of things separated by '\n'.

Each line is:
    <Type:'d'>;<Num:int>,<Name:str>(,\d+){4}
    <Type:'f'>;<Num:int>,<Name:str>(,\d+){11}
Type ::= d | f
        d: Dungeon (holds floors)
        f: Floor
Num  ::= int
        index. lower means shown lower on the list.
Name ::= [^,]+ | '[^']+'

Tail ints:
  d:
    [0]: floors
  f:
    [0]: floors
    [1]: mission number? no not unique
    [2]: stamina
    [-3]: Can be 5*4

pattern = re.compile(r"d;\d+,([^,]+|'[^']+')(,\d+){4}|f;\d+,([^,]+|'[^']+')(,\d+|,\d+\*\d+){9,}")



== Regex for manual parsing. ==

Tableize:
    Replace the first semi-colon.
    >   ^(\w);
    <   \1\t
    Commas which are outside of an even number of quotes.
    >   ^(?<=([^,']*+|'[^']*+')*+),
    <   \t
    ^ Without lookbehind:
    >   ^(([^,']*+|(?<=\t)'[^']*+')*),
    <   \1\t
    ^^ Screw it.
    ^ Looking ahead for a not-space.
    >   ,(?! )
    <   \t



== Bits set ==

# Which bits are set.
def setbits(n):
    #return filter(enumerate(map(int, bin(int(n))[:2][::-1]))
    return [i for i, b in enumerate(bin(int(n))[2:][::-1]) if b == '1']


== Ugh ==

TODO:
- Clean up these notes. Too much old contradictory garbage. Unclear what the new garbage is saying. Figure out whether I'm counting from 0 or 1.
- Break up the parsing so I can inspect intermediate parts.
    - E.g. So I can analyze what floors have what flag32s.
